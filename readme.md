# 3D Map for use with 2.5D isometric games

Thank you for stopping by this project! I am fairly new to Unity, and I am seeking help developing this tool further. If you want to help develop this, please stop by the [United Programming](https://discord.gg/invite/unitedprogramming) discord server.

## Project goals:

* Create a reusable map engine that can generate these kinds of maps.
* Should be easy to use with any renderer, but created with URP.
* Should work with future versions of Unity.
* Ready methods that the game might need to hook into the map, like modifying the terrain in real time.
* Do not include advanced water shaders, etc, that can not easially be converted to other renderers / future Unity versions.

## Current state

Sort of works, but really not ready for actual use.
